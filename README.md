A project to add items to a list.

Each line can be added containing NAME, DATE and AMOUNT entries or just one of these or just two,as you wish.

When a new line is added, the entries at the top are cleared again.

It is possible to add new lines with the ADD button or by pressing the 'Enter' key.

Each line has a button, at its right end, to delete the line in question.

There is a digit limit for NAME.

thanks.
